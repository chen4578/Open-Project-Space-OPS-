# Open Project Space (OPS)

This repository contains the projects I completed in OPS, a branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) at UCLA. Such projects provided electrical foundations including breadboarding, circuit design and analysis, and Arduino.

## Project Overviews

### iPoduino

This project featured a breadboard circuit with passive buzzers that were programmed to play various musical pieces.
