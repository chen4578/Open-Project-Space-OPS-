# Capstone Project

## Introduction

The capstone project involves building a battery-powered hand-following car. The controller we will be using is a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller so that the car can change its speed depending on the distance the hand is from the car. The car measures distance via an ultrasonic sensor.

### Breadboard Setup

#### Motors

To control the car motors, we use a L293D IC (integrated circuit) chip. The pins on the chip are shown in the image below.
