# Distance Sensor

## Introduction

In this project, I built a distance sensor using a phototransistor and an infrared emitter. The LED's luminosity depends on how far an object is from the IR receiver and emitter.

## Project Specifications

### Breadboard Setup

The main aspect of the circuit arrangement that we should be aware of is keeping the IR receiver and emitter close together so that the receiver can adequately sense the infrared light. The intution is provided in the following picture.
