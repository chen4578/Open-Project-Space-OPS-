# Communication Protocols

## Introduction

In this project, we make a tic-tac-toe game that is controlled by a joystick and displayed on an OLED screen.

### Breadboard Setup

For the hardware portion, we need to wire the OLED display and the joystick. Since the OLED utilizes the I2C communication protocol, it uses the Serial Data (SDA) and Serial Clock (SCL) pins.

The joystick requires three pins to record the joystick's x-axis position, y-axis position, and the joystick button.

The image below shows the circuit diagram.
