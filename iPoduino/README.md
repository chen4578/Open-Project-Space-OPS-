# iPoduino

## Introduction

The iPoduino is a music player that plays programmable music on a breadboard based on a specific button press. Users can select from "Jingle Bells," "Mary Had a Little Lamb," and "Never Gonna Give You Up." An RGB LED will light up when these songs are played. 

## Project Specifications

### Breadboard Implementation

Using PWM signals, we can create a variety of tones with a passive buzzer. Buttons (acting as switches) enable music selection. Using `digitalWrite` on the LED, we can power the individual LEDs separately.

An image of the breadboard simulation is provided below.

### Programming Music

To program the playlist, I applied the built-in functions `tone`, which generates a 50% duty cycle PWM square wave at a specific frequency, and `noTone`, which stops the previous tone. In addition, I downloaded the `pitches.h` library. Music was generated by inputting different notes into the `play` function and choosing the duration of `delay`.
