# iPoduino

## Introduction

The iPoduino is a music player that plays programmable music on a breadboard based on a specific button press. For this project, users can select from "Jingle Bells," "Mary Had a Little Lamb," and "Never Gonna Give You Up." Also, a RGB LED will light up when these songs are played. 

## Project Specifications

### Breadboard Implementation

Using PWM signals, we can create a variety of tones with a passive buzzer. Through employing buttons, which are essentially switches, we can select what song we desire to play. For the RGB LED, using digitalWrite, we can power the individual LEDs separately.

### Programming Music

To program the playlist, I applied the built-in functions `tone`, which generates a 50% duty cycle PWM square wave at a specific frequency and `noTone`, which stops the previous tone. In addition, I downloaded the 'pitches.h` library. Music was generated by inputting different notes into the `play` function and choosing the duration of `delay'.
